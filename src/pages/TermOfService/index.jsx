                    you are responsible for your security during staking. You
                    must keep your private keys safe at all times to avoid
                    losing your stakes and assets to third-party infiltrations.
                    If for any reason, you encounter difficulties using the
                    staking service (by Catex), you must understand that Blithe
                    Wallet will not be held responsible for it, as it’s not in
                    our power to maintain the staking service, we only offer it
                    through a third party partnership. Ensure you understand the
                    nitty-gritty of staking and using a third-party staking
                    service. You should also read Catex’s terms of service to
                    make sure you comply with their terms.

                    Blithe Wallet offers asset management and transfers. Assets
                    supported on Blithe Wallet primarily include
                    cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Other assets may include
                    tokenized items or resources usable on different DeFi
                    platforms (DApps). Blithe Wallet issues unique addresses for
                    cryptocurrencies and NFTs depending on the blockchain
                    network of the asset. Mistakes involving the use of one
                    address (or address of one asset) for another asset will
                    lead to the loss of the asset involved in such a
                    transaction. You must be careful during transactions to
                    avoid such mistakes as there will be no insurance or
                    reversals.{" "}

                    Blithe Wallet provides you with a private key which will be
                    used to authorize or sign any transaction in your wallet.
                    Blithe Wallet allows you to create multiple wallets on one
                    portal. You do not need different private keys for the
                    wallets created, as you can authorize transactions on all
                    the wallets using a single private key.

                  <p>
                    You must store your Blithe Wallet login details as we do not
                    offer a backup for your private key or passwords. We could
                    help you store your seed phrase which is accessible whenever
                    you want in the security info section. You must understand
                    that we do not read or disclose information regarding your
                    secret phrase (seed/mnemonic phrase), encrypted or decrypted
                    private keys, or passwords. We cannot generate a new seed
                    phrase for you if you lose yours. Also, we are not liable
                    if, by any reason or means, you are unable to log into your
                    wallet due to the misplacement of your login details, seed
                    phrase, or private key.

                Blithe Wallet allows two primary methods of wallet creation and
                accessibility: account importation or wallet creation from
                scratch. You can only import an existing account, say from a web
                browser to a standalone mobile wallet. When creating your wallet
                from scratch, ensure you activate multiple security login
                details such as biometric signatures, strong passwords, and
                authentication. Ensure you save or record your seed phrase for
                reference purposes, as once lost, cannot be recovered. Also,
                report any suspicions of a third-party infiltration to help
                protect the entire ecosystem and yourself from further or future
                damages.

                Blithe Wallet does not charge (or is not in direct control of
                potential) transaction fees. Transaction fees (gas) are usually
                determined by the underlying blockchain of assets or the
                ecosystem behind it. Always make sure you have an adequate
                balance before processing a transaction. Some token standards
                such as ERC20, TRC20, and so forth, require holding extra
                Ethereum (ETH) or Tron (TRX) coins to enable you to pay for
                gas/fees during transactions. Nevertheless, we could charge you
                for using additional services, not including crypto transactions
                or trading. There could be fees on fiat-to-crypto transactions,
                especially when using the Blithe virtual credit/debit cards.
                These fees are at flat rates and do not impose additional
                expenses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Taxes are another important area you must not neglect. It is
                your responsibility to understand the laws governing
                cryptocurrencies and taxes in your jurisdiction to avoid legal
                complications in the future. As such, you should learn about
                local laws on taxes and carry out regular tax audits and reports
                on crypto transactions done on Blithe Wallet.
